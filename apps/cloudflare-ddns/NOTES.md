# Notes on Cloudflare-DDNS

The only reason I have this as part of my homelab is because Google Fiber doesn't wanna give me a static IP. IPV6 is also disabled on my network due to some weird quirks on their end.

You can easily replace this with any other DDNS image, but I already (begrudgingly) use Cloudflare for some other things, so might as well...
